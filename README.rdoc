- Bitflower Soundlcoud application

* Bitflower is a simple rails app which uses the soundcloud api to list songs and tracks and provides an interface for a user to favorite and tweet selected soundcloud songs to their friends.

* In order to enable the tweets functionality a user must have both a soundcloud account and a twitter account. Twttier accounts are made possible on soundcloud throught the connections tab. Once a user has logged in through the soundcloud portal Bitflower is able to tweet their favorite tracks.
